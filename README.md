# Restful-booker API Test Automation

[Restful-booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) is *an API playground created by Mark Winteringham for those wanting to learn more about API testing and tools*.

This project is my attempt to learn API test automation using **Java** and **REST Assured**.

## Languages and Frameworks

The project uses the following:

- *[Java 11](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/)* as the programming language.
- *[REST Assured](https://rest-assured.io/)* as the REST API test automation framework.
- *[Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)* to generate getters, setters and builders.
- *[JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)* as the testing framework.
- *[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/)* as the matcher library.
- *[Datafaker](https://www.datafaker.net/)* as the fake data generation library.
- *[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)* as the Java build tool.
